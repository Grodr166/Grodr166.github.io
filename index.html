        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a therapist and chose to pursue this career as I have always wanted to help people. Throughout my life, I have considered many careers and all have involved helping people in some way. A career that always stood out to me was psychology but another career I considered was being a lawyer. I was able to intern at the Sonoma County Public Law Library and it was there that helped solidify my choice to become a therapist. It was there that my mentor told me that while lawyers help people at potentially their lowest, they arenâ€™t always able to do something, and even then, they canâ€™t help with what happens afterward. It wasnâ€™t the only factor that made my decision against being a lawyer but it is something that helped me to make my choice.<br><br>

        Psychology has been a field that has fascinated me ever since I was little. My sister would give me books and I would take personality quizzes about psychology. I knew I enjoyed helping people from that and have done some volunteer work. I volunteered at my townâ€™s food pantry which I enjoyed a lot and also helped clear some of the leaves at the graveyard. It was fulfilling work and something I have good memories of doing. It was great to feel like I was helping out my community.<br><br>

        I have been dedicated to psychology since high school where I took AP Psychology when I was able to. It helped prepare me for college and for the college classes I have taken on psychology. There, I got to learn more about psychology and the different ways that it can help people. I am taking a psychology statistics class that allows me to be better able to understand psychological statistics and studies. It would help me to understand studies that would be greatly important to being a therapist. I am better able to understand studies, what is significant, and utilize these studies. I plan to go to graduate school and pursue a masterâ€™s degree or a PhD.
